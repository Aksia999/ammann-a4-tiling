# ammann-a4-tiling
editing.java is a class with Java code for creating ammann a4 tiling genration.Notice that I'm working on modifying Rosetta Code.where the website is :https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling
notice that in code you can change generation value in line 47 to change the output.
notice that if your screen shows a blank output the line 211 " g.translate(-500,-500);" where the x and y value means the coordinate,you can change it to situable point to see the output

As for the kite_redraw java class,it is used to Replace tile graphics,you can change the appearance of tiles in tiles.zip but remember do not change their location so that they can fix each other by parameter in the programm.
you can also change the number of generation to see how high generation goes.
you can change the original tile type.
And thanks to my professor Darren Ong Chung Lee for guiding me.
