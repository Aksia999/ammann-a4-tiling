# ammann-a4-tiling
Java code for creating ammann a4 tiling genration.Notice that I'm working on modifying Rosetta Code.where the website is :https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling
notice that in code you can change generation value in line 47 to change the output.
notice that if your screen shows a blank output the line 211 " g.translate(-500,-500);" where the x and y value means the coordinate,you can change it to situable point to see the output
